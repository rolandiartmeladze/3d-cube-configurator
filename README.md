## Interactive 3D Cube Configurator

This simple web application allows users to interactively visualize and configure a **3D** cube. It was developed to showcase my ability to utilize new technologies like **Three.js** and **Vanilla JavaScript** in creating modern, responsive web interfaces, serving as a practical demonstration of my capabilities.
